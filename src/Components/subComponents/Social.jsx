                Engaging in Social and Community Services provide students with
                the opportunity to become active members of their community and
                has a lasting, positive impact on society at large. Social and
                Community Service or Volunteerism enables students to acquire
                life skills and knowledge, as well as provide a service to those
                who need it most. Also, it gives a good exposure to students to
                interact with the local community and to be aware of social
                issues. Volunteering helps students enhance their personal
                knowledge, grow from new experiences, and develop better
                interpersonal communication skills. Volunteering engages
                students with the community, creates special bonds with the
                population being served, and increases social awareness and
                responsibility. Keeping in this view, Sri Krishna College of
                Technology has instituted the Centre for Social and Community
                Services to serve the needy and the underprivileged as part of
                outreach activities.
