    "Electronic communications engineering is the utilization of science and mathematics applied to practical problems in the field of communications. The Electronics & Communication Engineering involves the transmission of information across channels such as a coax cable, optical fiber, or free space. Electronic communications engineers engage in research, design, development, and testing of the electronic equipment used in various communications systems. It is due to electronics and communication engineers that we enjoy such modern communication devices as cellular telephones, radios, and television. You can work on designing equipment such as routers, switches, multiplexers, and electronic switching systems, copper telephone facilities, and fiber optics.\r\n\r\n1985 - 2002\r\n    • BE ECE Program was started with an intake of 60\r\n2003 - 2005\r\n     • Intake of BE ECE Program was increased from 60 to 90\r\n2005 - 2011\r\n      • Intake of BE ECE Program was increased from 90 to 120\r\n2011 - Till date\r\n    • Intake of BE ECE Program was increased from 120 to 180",
