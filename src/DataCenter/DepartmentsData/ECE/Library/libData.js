    desc: 'The library serves as a central organ of academic activity in the Department. The Department has a rich & vast collection of more than 830 books, periodicals, and reports. It also has one copy each of all B.E. M.E. Projects, dissertations carried out in the department in recent years. All these cater to the needs of students and faculty. Most of the books are of recent edition with the facility of issuing these for a specified time period. The library serves to provide a calm and cozy ambiance conducive to long hours of study. The library opens on all working days of the Institute from 8.45 AM to 5 PM. Computerized cataloging and the active help of the library staff makes searching for volumes easy. \r\n<br/>\r\n<b>\r\nâ€œLibraries are reservoirs of strength,\r\ngrace and wit, reminders of order,\r\ncalm and continuity,\r\nlakes of mental energy,\r\nneither warm nor cold,\r\nlight nor dark.\r\nThe pleasure they give is steady,\r\nunorgastic, reliable,\r\ndeep and long-lasting".\r\n</b>  <i>  - Dr. Germaine Greer</i>',
