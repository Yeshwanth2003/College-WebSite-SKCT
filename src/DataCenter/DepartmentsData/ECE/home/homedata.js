  about:
    "Started in the year 1985, the Department of ECE has grown higher and is considered as one of the well-equipped departments across the state in terms of infrastructure, Curriculum and Content quality and quality of teaching faculty. While building a solid foundation of the fundamentals, the students are also exposed to emerging trends in the industry and are moulded to be quality professionals of the future. Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering aims at providing T- shaped learning through stream-based electives where students are provided with the choice of getting specialized in any one of the thrust areas like VLSI, Embedded Systems, Communication Engineering, Networks, Image and video processing. The department houses Electronics Sector Skills Council of India sponsored Centre of Excellence in VLSI and Embedded Systems (One of its Kind across Tamilnadu) to develop skilled manpower under the scheme of Skill India and Start-up India to meet the vision of the country, 'Make in India'. Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering has a sanctioned intake of 180 by AICTE and offers UG, PG and PhD Programmes in ECE. Department of ECE is accredited by NBA and permanently affiliated to Anna University, Chennai.",
