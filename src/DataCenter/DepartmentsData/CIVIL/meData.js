    "We also provide a post-graduate program in the Civil Engineering discipline- Structural Engineering which offers the students a chance to advance their knowledge above that of the undergraduate level. Studying for masters will enable the students to cover a wide range of topics not traditionally covered in undergraduate degrees; the program includes specialist modules in structural dynamics, bridge engineering, structural design, and professional engineering.\r\nStructural engineering is a continually evolving profession, and through the third Semester Research Project the students will learn how to apply this specialist knowledge to develop new concepts and ideas under the supervision of research-active academic staff. This program will distinguish them as having specialist knowledge in the area of Structural Engineering and provide them with a competitive edge over their peers in the job market.\r\n2002 - 2003\t\r\nM.E. Structural Engineering Program was started with an intake of 18 2013-2014\r\nIntake of the M.E. Structural Engineering Program was increased from 18 to 24",
