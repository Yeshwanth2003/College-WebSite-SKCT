     "about": "Sri Krishna College of Technology offers higher education in Engineering, Technology, and Management relevant to the current and projected needs of society. Being an autonomous institute, SKCT lays a strong emphasis on collaborative research and stands apart from other institutes by its participatory work culture, student care programs, and high industry interaction. To convert this knowledge into commercial products/processes a well-defined innovation and startup policy is needed.\r\n<br>Sri Krishna College of Technology has initiated the implementation of the National Institutional Start-up Policy (NISP) as proposed by the Ministry of Education Innovation Cell (MIC). This framework will be enabling the creation of robust innovation and start-up ecosystem in terms of Intellectual Property ownership management, technology licensing, and institutional start-up policy. \r\n<br>This policy encourages:\r\n<br>a) To establish Entrepreneurship Development and Innovation Councils (EDIC) headed by qualified faculty members to guide student-led Entrepreneurship Development Cell (EDC) to promote startups, entrepreneurship, and innovation activities among students in the Institutes \r\n<br>b) To permit both faculty and students to establish startups based on the research project works in the Institute.",
