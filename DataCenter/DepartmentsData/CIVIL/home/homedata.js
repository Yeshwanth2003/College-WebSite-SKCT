  about:
    "The Department of Civil Engineering was established in 1985. This was followed by a Post Graduate Programme in Structural Engineering in 2002 and Ph.D. Programme in 2007. All the Programmes are approved by AICTE and the UG Programme is accredited by NBA.\r\nDr. I. Padmanaban, HOD with a well qualified team of faculty provides the right academic atmosphere for the students to become Civil Engineers par excellence with an aptitude for research. In the past three decades, the department has seen a lot of progress in academics, research and consultancy activities. In addition, the department is recognized as a Research Centre by Anna University,Chennai. As of now about 19 scholars have earned their Ph.D. from our Research Centre and more than 30 scholars are pursuing Ph.D.\r\nWe have a dedicated faculty team of 11 members for UG,PG and Ph.D. programmes, out of which 6 are doctorates. The Department has state-of-the-art labs and classrooms.",
