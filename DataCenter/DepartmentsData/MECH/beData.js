    "Mechanical Engineering is a four-year undergraduate course that originated in 1985. The study, design, development, construction, and testing of mechanical and thermal sensors and devices, including such tools, engines, and machines, is known as mechanical engineering. Careers in mechanical engineering focus on developing technologies that address a wide range of human needs.\r\nAutomobile engineering, manufacturing engineering, power plant engineering, thermal engineering, and mechatronics engineering, which is a combination of electrical, computer, and mechanical engineering, are all mechanical engineering subjects.\r\n\r\n1985-1986\r\n  •  BE Mechanical Engineering program was started with an intake of 60\r\n\r\n2010-2011\r\n  •  Intake of BE Mechanical Engineering program increased from 60 to 120\r\n\r\n2012-2013\r\n  •  Intake of BE Mechanical Engineering program increased from 120 to 180",
